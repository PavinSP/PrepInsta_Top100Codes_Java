You are developing a feature for an environmental awareness app that helps users to know how much area their tree’s shadow cover. You have the distance D from a tree’s trunk to the edge of the shadow. Your task is to calculate and return an integer value representing the shadow are of the canopy.

Note: Round off the result nearest integer

Input Specification:
input1: An integer value D, representing the distance from the tree’s trunk to the edge of shadow

Output Specification:
Return an integer value representing the shadow are of the canopy.

Example 1:
Input1:5

Output: 78

Explanation: Here, D=5. So area of the canopy would be 3.14×5×5=78.5. Therefore, 78 will be returned as output.
