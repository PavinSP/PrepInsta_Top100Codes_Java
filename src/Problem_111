You are given an array A of length N. Your task is to find and return an integer value representing the difference between the sum of elements at odd index and XOR of elements at even index.

Input specification:
Input 1: An integer N representing the length of array
Input 2: An integer array A

Output specification
Return an integer value representing the difference between the sum of elements at odd index and XOR of elements at even index

Example 1:
Input 1: 6
Input 2: {10,5,6,3,7,2}

Output: 1

Explanation: Here N is 6 and the array A = {10,5,6,3,7,2}. The sum of elements at odd positions are 5+3+2=10 and XOR of elementâ€™s at even positions are 10 XOR 6XOR 7=11 and the difference is 10~11=1. Therefore 1 is returned as the output
