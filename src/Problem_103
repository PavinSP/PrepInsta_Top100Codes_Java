You are given array A, having some dividends. Further, you are given 3 numbers D, Q and R.
A dividend can be found using a rule that Dividend=Divisor*Quotient+Remainder.
Your task is to find and return an integer value representing the index of the dividend if present in array.
If dividend not found return 0.

Input Specification:
input1: An integer array A, containing dividends.
input2: An integer D, representing divisor.
input3: An integer Q, representing quotient.
input4: An integer R, representing remainder.
input5: An integer N, representing length of array A.

Output specification:
Return an integer value representing the index of the dividend if present in array.
If dividend not found return -1.
