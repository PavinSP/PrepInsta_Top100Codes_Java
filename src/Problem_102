An automobile company manufactures two-wheelers (TW) and four-wheelers (FW). Given the total number of vehicles and the total number of wheels, determine the number of two-wheelers and four-wheelers that need to be produced.

Input:

total_vehicles: The total number of vehicles (two-wheelers + four-wheelers).
total_wheels: The total number of wheels.
Output:

A tuple or list containing two values: the number of two-wheelers and the number of four-wheelers.
Example:

Input: total_vehicles = 10, total_wheels = 32
Output: (6, 4)  # 6 two-wheelers and 4 four-wheelers
Constraints:

total_vehicles and total_wheels will be positive integers.
It is guaranteed that a solution exists.
