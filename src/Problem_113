Alex is exploring a series and she can across a special series, in which
•	f(N) = f(N-1)* f(N-1)+ f(N-2)* f(N-2)
•	where f(0)=1, f(1)=1
Your task is to help Alex find and return an integer value, representing the Nth number in this special series.

Note: Return the output modulo 47.

Input specification:
Input 1: An integer value N

Output specification
Return an integer value, representing the Nth number in this special series.
