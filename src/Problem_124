You are given an integer array A of length N. Your task is to find and return an integer value representing the count of unique pairs whose products are multiples of 3.

A unique pair means that the order of the elements does not matter. For example, (1, 3) and (3, 1) are considered the same pair and should only be counted once.

Input Specification:
Input 1: An integer value N, representing the size of the array.
Input 2: An integer array A of size N.
Output Specification:
Return an integer value representing the count of unique pairs whose products are multiples of 3.
Example 1:
Input 1: 4

Input 2: {3, 6, 5, 4}

Output: 5

Explanation:
The pairs are:
(3, 6): Their product is 18, which is divisible by 3.
(3, 5): Their product is 15, which is divisible by 3.
(3, 4): Their product is 12, which is divisible by 3.
(6, 5): Their product is 30, which is divisible by 3.
(6, 4): Their product is 24, which is divisible by 3.
There are 5 such pairs.
Example 2:
Input 1: 5

Input 2: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}

Output: 4

Explanation:
The pairs are:
(3, 6): Their product is 18, which is divisible by 3.
(3, 1): Their product is 3, which is divisible by 3.
(3, 2): Their product is 6, which is divisible by 3.
(6, 2): Their product is 12, which is divisible by 3.
There are 4 such pairs.
