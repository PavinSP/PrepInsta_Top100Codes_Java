You are on a hiking trail represented by an array A of length N, where the trail first ascends to a summit and then descends, forming a single peak. Your task is to find and return an integer value representing the elevation of the summit (i.e., the highest point on the trail).

Input Specification:
Input 1: An integer array A representing the elevation points on the trail.
Input 2: An integer value N, representing the size of array A.

Output Specification:
Return an integer value representing the elevation of the summit (maximum value in the array).

Constraints:
The array A has exactly one peak (it ascends and then descends).
The size of the array N >= 3.
