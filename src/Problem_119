You are given a program to find the count of magical number from 1 to N. A magical number is defined by the following criteria.
•	Convert each number in the range 1 to N (inclusive) to its binary representation.
•	Replace ‘0’ with ‘1’ with ‘2’ in the binary string
•	Calculate the sum of the digits in the modified binary string. If the resultant number is odd then it is considered a magical number.
Your task is to find and return an integer value representing the count of the magical numbers present within the given range.

Input specification
Input1: An integer value N, representing the range of number.

Output specification
Return an integer value representing the count of the magical numbers present within the given range.

Example 1:

Input 1: 2

Output: 1

Explanation:
Here the given number is 2. We can find the magic numbers in the following manner.
•	1: 1 after replacing 1 with 2 the sum becomes 2, which is even.
•	2: 10 after replacing 1 with 2 the sum becomes 3, which is odd.
Since there is 1 odd sum present, 1 is returned as the output.
